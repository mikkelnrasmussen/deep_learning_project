# Deep learning project 2022 - Generative modelling for phenotypic profiling using Variational Autoencoders
This is a repository for the final project in Deep Learning fall 2022 at the technical university of Denmark (DTU). 

As the dataset utilized in this project was too large to upload to GitHub or download to a personal laptop, minimal examples provided in the `code` folder, which are named:
- `minimal_example_standard_VAE.ipynb`
- `minimal_example_VAE_plus.ipynb`
- `minimal_example_VAE_classifier_model.ipynb`
- `minimal_example_images_classifier_model.ipynb`

which respectively presents the code utilized to train the standard VAE annd VAE+ model as well as the classifier model utilizing the VAE/VAE+ latent representationns of the single-cell images and the classifier model utilizing the single-cell images directly as input.

The whole preprocessed dataset is available on the high-performance cluster (HPC) owned by DTU (G-bar) in the directory `/zhome/70/5/14854/nobackup/deeplearningf22/bbbc021/singlecell/`
