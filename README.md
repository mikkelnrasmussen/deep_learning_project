# Deep learning project 2022 - Single Cell Images
This is a repository for the final project in Deep Learning at DTU. 

As the dataset utilized in this project was too large to upload to GitHub or download to a personal laptop, minimal examples provided in the `code` folder, which are named:
- `minimal_example_standard_VAE.ipynb`
- `minimal_example_VAE_plus.ipynb`
- `minimal_example_VAE_classifier_model.ipynb`
- `minimal_example_images_classifier_model.ipynb`

which respectively presents the code utilized to train the standard VAE annd VAE+ model as well as the classifier model utilizing the VAE/VAE+ latent representationns of the single-cell images and the classifier model utilizing the single-cell images directly as input.
